# SECURE CREDENTIALS BACKEND

I have created this project with the objective of building a backend to manage credentials in a secure way.

The goal is to have an authentication system which contains the best practices defined in the following groups:

Authentication and Authorization:

* Password Hashing
* Multifactor Authentication (MFA)
* Use of JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
* Limiting Login Attempts
* Secure Password Policies

Data Management and Protection:

* Principle of Least Privilege
* Input Validation
* Encryption in Transit and at Rest
* Secure Secrecy Handling

API and Server Security:

* Secure Endpoints
* Logs and Monitoring
* Updates and Patches
* HTTP Security Headers
  * Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
  * Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS):
  * X-Content-Type-Options
